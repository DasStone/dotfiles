Hi :)

## References

Some parts of my setup are heavily inspired by others.

### User [Treeniks](https://github.com/Treeniks):
- **nvim**: He basically taught me almost everything I know about vim/nvim. So I inherited his setup.
- **waybar**: I used his **waybar** as a starting point, since it is designed to work with minimal linux installs (no bullshit, clean and simple). I color matched my version to match the catppuccin-mocha palette and added some simple additional elements.
- **dotfiles organisation**: I really liked his `link.jl` scripts!

### User [AndreasChris](https://github.com/AndreasChris):
- **vim**: I'm currently using **nvim** as my main editor, but sometimes it might not be possible for me to use it (e.g. remote server where I can't install any packages). Andreas was so kind to give me his `.vimrc` which I found to be very reliable. I probably won't change it, since I will use **nvim** vherever possible. Here is a [link](https://itsec.tum.academy/.vimrc) to his `vim.rc`.

## Bootloader

I personally like to use **Grub**, since it has always worked for me without a hitch.
